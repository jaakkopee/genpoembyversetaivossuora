CALLED

FRATER PERDURABO
  (Aleister Crowley)

      UNTRUE

      At the foot of thy stones, O Sea!
And I would that I could utter

      COMMENTARY (Title Page)
The number of the book is 333, as implying dis-
  persion, so as to correspond with the title, "Breaks"
    and "Lies".
      However, the "one thought is itself untrue", and
therefore its falsifications are relatively true.
  This book therefore consists of statements as nearly
    true as is possible to human language.
      The verse from Tennyson is inserted partly because
of the pun on the word "break"; partly because of the
  reference to the meaning of this title page, as explained
    above; partly because it is intensely amusing for
      Crowley to quote Tennyson.
There is no joke or subtle meaning in the publisher's
  imprint.
    FOREWORD
      THE BOOK OF LIES, first published in London
in 1913, Aleister Crowley's little master work, has
  long been out of print.  Its re-issue with the author's
    own Commentary gives occasion for a few notes.  We
      have so much material by Crowley himself about this
book that we can do no better that quote some
  passages which we find scattered about in the un-
    published volumes of his "CONFESSIONS."  He
      writes:
"...None the less, I could point to some solid
  achievement on the large scale, although it is com-
    posed of more or less disconnected elements.  I refer
      to THE BOOK OF LIES.  In this there are 93 chapters:
we count as a chapter the two pages filled re-
  respectively with a note of interrogation and a mark of
    exclamation.  The other chapters contain sometimes a
      single word, more frequently from a half-dozen to
twenty paragraphs.  The subject of each chapter is
  determined more or less definitely by the Qabalistic
    import of its number.  Thus Chapter 25 gives a revised
      ritual of the Pentagram; 72 is a rondel with the refrain
~Shemhamphorash', the Divine name of 72 letters;
  77 Laylah, whose name adds to that number; and
    80, the number of the letter Pe, referred to Mars, a
      panegyric upon War.  Sometimes the text is serious
and straightforward, sometimes its obscure oracles
  demand deep knowledge of the Qabalah for inter-
    pretation, others contain obscure allusions, play
      upon words, secrets expressed in cryptogram, double
or triple meanings which must be combined in order
  [5]
    to appreciate the full flavour; others again are
      subtly ironical or cynical.  At first sight the book is a
jumble of nonsense intended to insult the reader.  It
  requires infinite study, sympathy, intuition and
    initiation.  Given these I do not hesitate to claim that
      in none other of my writings have I given so pro-
found and comprehensive an exposition of my
  philosophy on every plane...."
    "...My association with Free Masonry was there-
      fore destined to be more fertile that almost any other
study, and that in a way despite itself.  A word should
  be pertinent with regard to the question of secrecy.
    It has become difficult for me to take this matter
      very seriously.  Knowing what the secret actually is,
I cannot attach much importance to artificial
  mysteries.  Again, though the secret itself is of such
    tremendous import, and though it is so simple that
      I could disclose it...in a short paragraph, I might
do so without doing much harm.  For it cannot be used
  indiscriminately...I have found in practice that the
    secret of the O.T.O. cannot be used unworthily...."
      "It is interesting in this connection to recall how it
came into my possession.  It had occurred to me to
  write a book `THE BOOK OF LIES, WHICH IS
    ALSO FALSELY CALLED BREAKS, THE
      WANDERINGS OR FALSIFICATION OF THE
THOUGHT OF FRATER PERDURABO WHICH
  THOUGHT IS ITSELF UNTRUE. . . .'  One of
    these chapters bothered me.  I could not write it.  I
      invoked Dionysus with particular fervour, but still
without success.  I went off in desperation to `change
  my luck', by doing something entirely contrary to
    my inclinations.  In the midst of my disgust, the
      spirit came over me, and I scribbled the chapter
down by the light of a farthing dip.. When I read it
  over, I was as discontented as before, but I stuck it
    into the book in a sort of anger at myself as a
      deliberate act of spite towards my readers.
[6]
  "Shortly after publication, the O.H.O. (Outer
    Head of the O.T.O.) came to me.  (At that time I did
      not realise that there was anything in the O.T.O.
beyond a convenient compendium of the more
  important truths of Free Masonry.)  He said that since
    I was acquainted with the supreme secret of the
      Order, I must be allowed the IX {degree} and obligated in
regard to it.  I protested that I knew no such secret.
  He said `But you have printed it in the plainest
    language'.  I said that I could not have done so
      because I did not know it.  He went to the book-
shelves; taking out a copy of THE BOOK OF LIES, he
  pointed to a passage in the despised chapter.  It
    instantly flashed upon me.  The entire symbolism not
      only of Free Masonry but of many other traditions
blazed upon my spiritual vision.  From that moment
  the O.T.O. assumed its proper importance in my
    mind.  I understood that I held in my hands the key
      to the future progress of humanity...."
The Commentary was written by Crowley prob-
  ably around 1921.  The student will find it very
    helpful for the light it throws on many of its passages.

    COMMENTARY (The Chapter that is not a Chapter)
      This chapter, numbered 0, corresponds to the Negative,
which is before Kether in the Qabalistic system.
  The notes of interrogation and exclamation on the previous
    pages are the other two veils.
      The meaning of these symbols is fully explained in "The
Soldier and the Hunchback".
  This chapter begins by the letter O, followed by a mark of
    exclamation; its reference to the theogony of "Liber Legis" is
      explained in the note, but it also refers to KTEIS PHALLOS
and SPERMA, and is the exclamation of wonder or ecstasy,
  which is the ultimate nature of things.
    NOTE
      (1) Silence. Nuit, O; Hadit; Ra-Hoor-Khuit, I.
COMMENTARY (The Ante Primal Triad)
  This is the negative Trinity; its three statements are, in an
    ultimate sense, identical. They harmonise Being, Becoming,
      Not-Being, the three possible modes of conceiving the universe.
The statement, Nothing is Not , technically equivalent to
  Something Is, is fully explained in the essay called Berashith.
    The rest of the chapter follows the Sephirotic system of the
      Qabalah, and constitutes a sort of quintessential comment upon
that system.
  Those familiar with that system will recognise Kether,
    Chokmah, Binah, in the First Triad; Daath, in the Abyss; Chesed,
      Geburah, Tiphareth, in the Second Triad; Netzach, Hod and
Yesod in the Third Triad, and Malkuth in the Tenth Emanation.
  It will be noticed that this cosmogony is very complete; the
    manifestation even of God does not appear until Tiphareth; and
      the universe itself not until Malkuth.
The chapter many therefore be considered as the most complete
  treatise on existence ever written.
    NOTE
      (2) The Unbroken, absorbing all, is called Darkness.

      THE SABBATH OF THE GOAT
O! the heart of N.O.X. the Night of Pan.
  {Pi-Alpha-Nu}: Duality: Energy: Death.
    Death: Begetting: the supporters of O!
      To beget is to die; to die is to beget.
Cast the Seed into the Field of Night.
  Life and Death are two names of A.
    Kill thyself.
      Neither of these alone is enough.
[12]
  COMMENTARY ({Alpha})
    The shape of the figure I suggests the Phallus; this
      chapter is therefore called the Sabbath of the Goat, the
Witches' Sabbath, in which the Phallus is adored.
  The chapter begins with a repetition of O! referred
    to in the previous chapter.  It is explained that this triad
      lives in Night, the Night of Pan, which is mystically
called N.O.X., and this O is identified with the O in
  this word.  N is the Tarot symbol, Death; and the X
    or Cross is the sign of the Phallus.  For a fuller com-
      mentary on Nox, see Liber VII, Chapter I.
Nox adds to 210, which symbolises the reduction of
  duality to unity, and thence to negativity, and is thus
    a hieroglyph of the Great Work.
      The word Pan is then explained, {Pi}, the letter of
Mars, is a hieroglyph of two pillars, and therefore
  suggest duality; A, by its shape, is the pentagram,
    energy, and N, by its Tarot attribution, is death.
      Nox is then further explained, and it is shown that
the ultimate Trinity, O!, is supported, or fed, by the
  process of death and begetting, which are the laws of
    the universe.
      The identity of these two is then explained.
The Student is then charged to understand the
  spiritual importance of this physical procession in
    line 5.
      It is then asserted that the ultimate letter A has two
names, or phases, Life and Death.
  Line 7 balances line 5.  It will be notice that the
    phraseology of these two lines is so conceived that the
      one contains the other more than itself.
Line 8 emphasises the importance of performing
  both.

      Thy Kingdom is come.
Thy Will is done.

      Bring us through Temptation!
Deliver us from Good and Evil!

  III, 49.
    Those four words, Do What Thou Wilt, are also
      identified with the four possible modes of conceiving the
universe; Horus unites these.
  Follows a version of the "Lord's Prayer", suitable
    to Horus.  Compare this with the version in Chapter 44.
      There are ten sections in this prayer, and, as the prayer
is attributed to Horus, they are called four, as above
  explained; but it is only the name of Horus which is
    fourfold; He himself is One.
      This may be compared with the Qabalistic doctrine
of the Ten Sephiroth as an expression of Tetra-
  grammaton (1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 = 10).
    It is now seen that this Hawk is not Solar, but
      Mercurial; hence the words, the Cry of the Hawk, the
essential part of Mercury being his Voice; and the
  number of the chapter, B, which is Beth the letter of
    Mercury, the Magus of the Tarot, who has four
      weapons, and it must be remembered that this card is
numbered 1, again connecting all these symbols with
  the Phallus.
    The essential weapon of Mercury is the Caduceus.

  THE OYSTER
    The Brothers of A.'.A.'. are one with the Mother of
      the Child.(4)
The Many is as adorable to the One as the One is to
  the Many.  This is the Love of These; creation-
    parturition is the Bliss of the One; coition-
      dissolution is the Bliss of the Many.
The All, thus interwoven of These, is Bliss.
  Naught is beyond Bliss.
    The Man delights in uniting with the Woman; the
      Woman in parting from the Child.
The Brothers of A.'.A.'. are Women: the Aspirants
  to A.'.A.'. are Men.
    [16]
      COMMENTARY ({Gamma})
Gimel is the High Priestess of the Tarot.  This
  chapter gives the initiated feminine point of view; it is
    therefore called the Oyster, a symbol of the Yoni.  In
      Equinox X, The Temple of Solomon the King, it is
explained how Masters of the Temple, or Brothers of
  A.'.A.'. have changed the formula of their progress.
    These two formulae, Solve et Coagula, are now ex-
      plained, and the universe is exhibited as the interplay
between these two.  This also explains the statement in
  Liber Legis I, 28-30.

  To all impressions thus.  Let them not overcome thee;
    yet let them breed within thee.  The least of the

    This child shall be the heir of Fate the Father.
      [18]
COMMENTARY ({Delta})
  Daleth is the Empress of the Tarot, the letter of
    Venus, and the title, Peaches, again refers to the Yoni.
      The chapter is a counsel to accept all impressions;
it is the formula of the Scarlet woman; but no impression
  must be allowed to dominate you, only to fructify you;
    just as the artist, seeing an object, does not worship it,
      but breeds a masterpiece from it.  This process is
exhibited as one aspect of the Great Work.  The last
  two paragraphs may have some reference to the 13th
    Aethyr (see The Vision and The Voice).

    THE BATTLE OF THE ANTS
      That is not which is.
The only Word is Silence.
  The only Meaning of that Word is not.
    Thoughts are false.
      Fatherhood is unity disguised as duality.
Peace implies war.
  Power implies war.
    Harmony implies war.
      Victory implies war.
Glory implies war.
  Foundation implies war.
    Alas!  for the Kingdom wherein all these are at war.
      [20]
COMMENTARY ({Epsilon})
  He is the letter of Aries, a Martial sign; while the
    title suggests war.  The ants are chosen as small busy
      objects.
Yet He, being a holy letter, raises the beginning of the
  chapter to a contemplation of the Pentagram, con-
    sidered as a glyph of the ultimate.
      In line 1, Being is identified with Not-Being.
In line 2, Speech with Silence.
  In line 3, the Logos is declared as the Negative.
    Line 4 is another phrasing of the familiar Hindu
      statement, that that which can be thought is not true.
In line 5, we come to an important statement, an
  adumbration of the most daring thesis in this book-
    Father and Son are not really two, but one; their unity
      being the Holy Ghost, the semen; the human form is a
non-essential accretion of this quintessence.
  So far the chapter has followed the Sephiroth from
    Kether to Chesed, and Chesed is united to the Supernal
      Triad by virtue of its Phallic nature; for not only is
Amoun a Phallic God, and Jupiter the Father of All,
  but 4 is Daleth, Venus, and Chesed refers to water,
    from which Venus sprang, and which is the symbol of
      the Mother in the Tetragrammaton.  See Chapter 0,
"God the Father and Mother is concealed in genera-
  tion".
    But Chesed, in the lower sense, is conjoined to
      Microprosopus.  It is the true link between the greater
and lesser countenances, whereas Daath is the false.
  Compare the doctrine of the higher and lower Manas in
    Theosophy.
      The rest of the chapter therefor points out the duality,
and therefore the imperfection, of all the lower Sephiroth
  in their essence.

  CAVIAR
    The Word was uttered: the One exploded into one
      thousand million worlds.
Each world contained a thousand million spheres.
  Each sphere contained a thousand million planes.
    Each plane contained a thousand million stars.
      Each star contained a many thousand million things.
Of these the reasoner took six, and, preening, said:
  This is the One and the All.
    These six the Adept harmonised, and said: This is the
      Heart of the One and the All.
These six were destroyed by the Master of the
  Temple; and he spake not.
    The Ash thereof was burnt up by the Magus into
      The Word.
Of all this did the Ipsissimus know Nothing.
  [22]
    COMMENTARY ({Digamma})
      This chapter is presumably called Caviar because
that substance is composed of many spheres.
  The account given of Creation is the same as that
    familiar to students of the Christian tradition, the
      Logos transforming the unity into the many.
We then see what different classes of people do with
  the many.
    The Rationalist takes the six Sephiroth of Micro-
      prosopus in a crude state, and declares them to be the
universe.  This folly is due to the pride of reason.
  The Adept concentrates the Microcosm in Tiphareth,
    recognising an Unity, even in the microcosm, but, qua
      Adept, he can go no further.
The Master of the Temple destroys all these illusions,
  but remains silent.  See the description of his functions
    in the Equinox, Liber 418 and elsewhere.
      In the next grade, the Word is re-formulated, for the
Magus in Chokmah, the Dyad, the Logos.
  The Ipsissimus, in the highest grade of the A.'.A.'.,
    is totally unconscious of this process, or, it might be
      better to say, he recognises it as Nothing, in that positive
sense of the word, which is only intelligible in
  Samasamadhi.

Amen.
  [29]
    COMMENTARY ({Zeta})
      This chapter gives a list of those special messengers
of the Infinite who initiate periods.  they are called
  Dinosaurs because of their seeming to be terrible
    devouring creatures.  They are Masters of the Temple,
      for their number is 6 (1 plus 2 plus 3), the mystic
number of Binah; but they are called "None", because
  they have attained.  If it were not so, they would be
    called "six" in its bad sense of mere intellect.
      They are called Seven, although they are Eight,
because Lao-tzu counts as nought, owing to the nature
  of his doctrine.  The reference to their "living not" is
    to be found in Liber 418.
      The word "Perdurabo" means "I will endure unto
the end".  The allusion is explained in the note.
  Siddartha, or Gotama, was the name of the last
    Budda.
      Krishna was the principal incarnation of the Indian
Vishnu, the preserver, the principal expounder of
  Vedantism.
    Tahuti, or Thoth, the Egyptian God of Wisdom.
      Mosheh, Moses, the founder of the Hebrew system.
Dionysus, probably an ecstatic from the East.
  Mahmud, Mohammed.
    All these were men; their Godhead is the result of
      mythopoeia.
NOTES
  (5) Masters of the Temple, whose grade has the
    mystic number 6 (= 1 + 2 + 3).
      (6) These are not eight, as apparent; for Lao-tzu
counts as 0.
  (7) The legend of "Christ" is only a corruption and
    perversion of other legends.  Especially of Dionysus:
      compare the account of Christ before Herod/Pilate in
the gospels, and of Dionysus before Pentheus in
  "The Baccae".
    (8) O, the last letter of Perdurabo, is Naught.

    STEEPED HORSEHAIR
      Mind is a disease of semen.
All that a man is or may be is hidden therein.
  Bodily functions are parts of the machine; silent,
    unless in dis-ease.
      But mind, never at ease, creaketh "I".
This I persisteth not, posteth not through genera-
  tions, changeth momently, finally is dead.
    Therefore is man only himself when lost to himself
      in The Charioting.
[26]
  COMMENTARY ({Eta})
    Cheth is the Chariot in the Tarot.  The Charioteer is
      the bearer of the Holy Grail.  All this should be studied
in Liber 418, the 12th Aethyr.
  The chapter is called "Steeped Horsehair" because
    of the mediaeval tradition that by steeping horsehair
      a snake is produced, and the snake is the hieroplyphic
representation of semen, particularly in Gnostic and
  Egyptian emblems.
    The meaning of the chapter is quite clear; the whole
      race-consciousness, that which is omnipotent, omnis-
cient, omnipresent, is hidden therein.
  Therefore, except in the case of an Adept, man only
    rises to a glimmer of the universal consciousness, while,
      in the orgasm, the mind is blotted out.

Being is the Noun; Form is the adjective.
  Matter is the Noun; Motion is the Verb.
    Wherefore hath Being clothed itself with Form?
      Wherefore hath Matter manifested itself in Motion?
Answer not, O silent one!  For THERE is no "where-
  fore", no "because".
    The name of THAT is not known; the Pronoun
      interprets, that is , misinterprets, It.
Time and Space are Adverbs.
  Duality begat the Conjunction.
    The Conditioned is Father of the Preposition.
      The Article also marketh Division; but the Inter-
jeciton is the sound that endeth in the Silence.
  Destroy therefore the Eight Parts of Speech; the
    Ninth is nigh unto Truth.
      This also must be destroyed before thou enterest
into The Silence.
  Aum.
    [28]
      COMMENTARY ({Theta})
Teth is the Tarot trump, Strength, in which a woman
  is represented closing the mouth of a lion.
    This chapter is called "The Branks", an even more
      powerful symbol, for it is the Scottish, and only known,
apparatus for closing the mouth of a woman.
  The chapter is formally an attack upon the parts of
    speech, the interjection, the meaningless utterance of
      ecstasy, being the only thing worth saying; yet even this
is to be regarded as a lapse.
  "Aum" represents the entering into the silence, as
    will observed upon pronouncing it.

    WINDLESTRAWS
      The Abyss of Hallucinations has Law and Reason;
but in Truth there is no bond between the Toys of
  the Gods.
    This Reason and Law is the Bond of the Great Lie.
      Truth! Truth! Truth! crieth the Lord of the Abyss
of Hallucinations.
  There is no silence in that Abyss: for all that men
    call Silence is Its Speech.
      This Abyss is also called "Hell", and "The Many".
Its name is "Consciousness", and "The Universe",
  among men.
    But THAT which neither is silent, nor speaks, re-
      joices therein.
[30]
  COMMENTARY ({Iota})
    There is no apparent connection between the number
      of this chapter and its subject.
It does, however, refer to the key of the Tarot called
  The Hermit, which represents him as cloaked.
    Jod is the concealed Phallus as opposed to Tau, the
      extended Phallus.  This chapter should be studied in
the light of what is said in "Aha!" and in the Temple
  of Solomon the King about the reason.
    The universe is insane, the law of cause and effect
      is an illusion, or so it appears in the Abyss, which is
thus identified with consciousness, the many, and both;
  but within this is a secret unity which rejoices; this
    unit being far beyond any conception.

    THE GLOW-WORM
      Concerning the Holy Three-in-Naught.
Nuit, Hadit, Ra-Hoor-Khuit, are only to be under-
  stood by the Master of the Temple.
    They are above The Abyss, and contain all con-
      tradiction in themselves.
Below them is a seeming duality of Chaos and
  Babalon; these are called Father and Mother, but
    it is not so.  They are called Brother and Sister,
      but it is not so.  They are called Husband and
Wife, but it is not so.
  The reflection of All is Pan: the Night of Pan is the
    Annihilation of the All.
      Cast down through The Abyss is the Light, the Rosy
Cross, the rapture of Union that destroys, that is
  The Way.  The Rosy Cross is the Ambassador of Pan.
    How infinite is the distance form This to That! Yet
      All is Here and Now.  Nor is there any there or Then;
for all that is, what is it but a manifestation, that is,
  a part, that is, a falsehood, of THAT which is not?
    Yet THAT which is not neither is nor is not That
      which is!
Identity is perfect; therefore the w of Identity is
  but a lie.  For there is no subject, and there is no
    predicate; nor is there the contradictory of either
      of these things.
Holy, Holy, Holy are these Truths that I utter,
  knowing them to be but falsehoods, broken mirrors,
    troubled waters; hide me, O our Lady, in Thy
      Womb! for I may not endure the rapture.
In this utterance of falsehood upon falsehood, whose
  contradictories are also false, it seems as if That
    which I uttered not were true.
      Blessed, unutterably blessed, is this last of the
illusions; let me play the man, and thrust it from
  me!  Amen.
    [32]
      COMMENTARY ({Iota Alpha})
"The Glow-Worm" may perhaps be translated as
  "a little light in the darkness", though there may be a
    subtle reference to the nature of that light.
      Eleven is the great number of Magick, and this
chapter indicates a supreme magical method; but it is
  really called eleven, because of Liber Legis, I, 60.
    The first part of the chapter describes the universe
      in its highest sense, down to Tiphareth; it is the new
and perfect cosmogony of Liber Legis.
  Chaos and Babalon are Chokmah and Binah, but
    they are really one; the essential unity of the supernal
      Triad is here insisted upon.
Pan is a generic name, including this whole system
  of its manifested side.  Those which are above the Abyss
    are therefore said to live in the Night of Pan; they are
      only reached by the annihilation of the All.
Thus, the Master of the Temple lives in the Night of
  Pan.
    Now, below the Abyss, the manifested part of the
      Master of the temple, also reaches Samadhi, as the
way of Annihilation.
  Paragraph 7 begins by a reflection produced by the
    preceding exposition.  This reflection is immediately
      contradicted, the author being a Master of the Temple.
He thereupon enters into his Samadhi, and he piles
  contradiction upon contradiction, and thus a higher
    degree of rapture, with ever sentence, until his armoury
      is exhausted, and, with the word Amen, he enters the
supreme state.

THE DRAGON-FLIES
  IO is the cry of the lower as OI of the higher.
    In figures they are 1001;(9) in letters they are Joy.(10)
      For when all is equilibrated, when all is beheld from
without all, there is joy, joy, joy that is but one
  facet of a diamond, every other facet whereof is
    more joyful than joy itself.
      [34]
COMMENTARY ({Iota Beta})
  The Dragon-Flies were chosen as symbols of joy,
    because of the author's observation as a naturalist.
      Paragraph 1 mere repeats Chapter 4 in quintessence;
1001, being 11{Sigma} (1-13), is a symbol of the complete
  unity manifested as the many, for {Sigma} (1-13) gives the
    whole course of numbers from the simple unity of 1
      to the complex unity of 13, impregnated by the magical
11.
  I may add a further comment on the number 91.
    13 (1 plus 3) is a higher form of 4.  4 is Amoun, the
      God of generation, and 13 is 1, the Phallic unity.
Daleth is the Yoni.  And 91 is AMN (Amen), a form
  of the Phallus made complete through the intervention
    of the Yoni.  This again connects with the IO and OI
      of paragraph 1, and of course IO is the rapture-cry of
the Greeks.
  The whole chapter is, again, a comment on Liber
    legis, 1, 28-30.

    The Universe is the Practical Joke of the General

  But those disciples nearest to him wept, seeing the

    it safe to act like FRATER PERDURABO.
      But though FRATER PERDURABO laughed
openly, He also at the same time wept secretly;
  and in Himself He neither laughed nor wept.
    Nor did He mean what He said.
      [38]
COMMENTARY ({Iota-Delta})
  The title, "Onion-Peelings", refers to the well-known
    incident in "Peer Gynt".
      The chapter resembles strongly Dupin's account of
how he was able to win at the game of guessing odd or
  even.  (See Poe's tale of "The Purloined Letter".)
    But this is a more serious piece of psychology.  In one's
      advance towards a comprehension of the universe, one
changes radically one's point of view; nearly always it
  amounts to a reversal.
    this is the cause of most religious controversies.
      Paragraph 1, however, is Frater Perdurabo's formula-
tion of his perception of the Universal Joke, also
  described in Chapter 34.  All individual existence is
    tragic.  Perception of this fact is the essence of comedy.
      "Household Gods" is an attempt to write pure comedy.
"The Bacchae" of Euripides is another.
  At the end of the chapter it is, however, seen that to
    the Master of the Temple the opposite perception occurs
      simultaneously, and that he himself is beyond both of
these.
  And in the last paragraph it is shown that he realises
    the truth as beyond any statement of it.

  through which I am no longer I.
    [40]
      COMMENTARY ({Iota-Epsilon})
The card 15 in the Tarot is "The Devil", the
  mediaeval blind for Pan.
    The title of the chapter refers to the Phallus, which
      is here identified with the will.  The Greek word
{Pi-upsilon-rho-alpha-mu-iota-sigma}
  has the same number as {Phi-alpha-lambda-lambda-omicron-sigma}.
    This chapter is quite clear, but one my remark in
      the last paragraph a reference to the nature of Samadhi.
As man loses his personality in physical love, so
  does the magician annihilate his divine personality in
    that which is beyond.
      The formula of Samadhi is the same, from the
lowest to the highest.  The Rosy-Cross is the Universal
  Key.  But, as one proceeds, the Cross becomes greater,
    until it is the Ace, the Rose, until it is the Word.

    THE STAG-BEETLE
      Death implies change and individuality if thou be
THAT which hath no person, which is beyond the
  changing, even beyond changelessness, what hast
    thou to do with death?
      The bird of individuality is ecstasy; so also is its
death.
  In love the individuality is slain; who loves not love?
    Love death therefore, and long eagerly for it.
      Die Daily.
[42]
  COMMENTARY ({Iota-Sigma})
    This seems a comment on the previous chapter; the
      Stag-Beetle is a reference the Kheph-ra, the Egyptian
God of Midnight, who bears the Sun through the
  Underworld; but it is called the Stag-Beetle to emphasise
    his horns.  Horns are the universal hieroglyph of energy,
      particularly of Phallic energy.
The 16th key of the Tarot is "The Blasted Tower".
  In this chapter death is regarded as a form of marriage.
    Modern Greek peasants, in many cases, cling to Pagan
      belief, and suppose that in death they are united to the
Deity which they have cultivated during life.  This is "a
  consummation devoutly to be wished" (Shakespeare).
    In the last paragraph the Master urges his pupils to
      practise Samadhi every day.

      THE SWAN(11)
There is a Swan whose name is Ecstasy: it wingeth
  from the Deserts of the North;it wingeth through
    the blue; it wingeth over the fields of rice; at its
      coming they push forth the green.
In all the Universe this Swan alone is motionless; it
  seems to move, as the Sun seems to move; such
    is the weakness of our sight.
      O fool! criest thou?
Amen. Motion is relative: there is Nothing that is
  still.
    Against this Swan I shot an arrow; the white breast
      poured forth blood.  Men smote me; then, per-
ceiving that I was but a Pure Fool, they let me
  pass.
    Thus and not otherwise I came to the Temple of the
      Graal.
[44]
  COMMENTARY ({Iota-Zeta})
    This Swan is Aum.  The chapter is inspired by
      Frater P.'s memory of the wild swans he shot in the
Tali-Fu.
  In paragraphs 3 and 4 it is, however, recognised that
    even Aum is impermanent.  There is no meaning in the
      word, stillness, so long as motion exists.
In a boundless universe, one can always take any
  one point, however mobile, and postulate it a a point
    at rest, calculating the motions of all other points
      relatively to it.
The penultimate paragraph shows the relations of
  the Adept to mankind.  Their hate and contempt are
    necessary steps to his acquisition of sovereignty over
      them.
The story of the Gospel, and that of Parsifal, will
  occur to the mind.
    NOTE
      (11) This chapter must be read in connection with
Wagner's "Parsifal".

DEWDROPS
  Verily, love is death, and death is life to come.
    Man returneth not again; the stream floweth not
      uphill; the old life is no more; there is a new life
that is not his.
  Yet that life is of his very essence; it is more He
    than all that he calls He.
      In the silence of a dewdrop is every tendency of his
soul, and of his mind, and of his body; it is the
  Quintessence and the Elixir of his being.  Therein
    are the forces that made him and his father and his
      father's father before him.
This is the Dew of Immortality.
  Let this go free, even as It will; thou art not its
    master, but the vehicle of It.
      [46]
COMMENTARY ({Iota-Eta})
  The 18th key of the Tarot refers to the Moon, which
    was supposed to shed dew.  The appropriateness of the
      chapter title is obvious.
The chapter must be read in connection with
  Chapters 1 and 16.
    I the penultimate paragraph, Vindu is identified
      with Amrita, and in the last paragraph the disciple is
charged to let it have its own way.  It has a will of its
  own, which is more in accordance with the Cosmic Will,
    than that of the man who is its guardian and servant.

    The dappling of the deer is the sunlight in the glade;

      This is that which is written-Lurk!-in The Book

  [48]
    COMMENTARY ({Iota-Theta})
      19 is the last Trump, "The Sun', which is the
representative of god in the Macrocosm, as the Phallus
  is in the Microcosm.
    There is a certain universality and adaptability
      among its secret power.  The chapter is taken from
Rudyard Kiplin's "Just So Stories".
  The Master urges his disciples to a certain holy
    stealth, a concealment of the real purpose of their lives;
      in this way making the best of both worlds.  This counsels
a course of action hardly distinguishable from hypocrisy;
  but the distinction is obvious to any clear thinker,
    though not altogether so the Frater P.

      The Universe is in equilibrium; therefore He that is
without it, though his force be but a feather, can
  overturn the Universe.

    COMMENTARY ({Kappa})
      Samson, the Hebrew Hercules, is said in the legend
to have pulled down the walls of a music-hall where he
  was engaged, "to make sport for the Philistines",
    destroying them and himself.  Milton founds a poem on
      this fable.
The first paragraph is a corollary of Newton's First
  Law of Motion.  The key to infinite power is to reach
    the Bornless Beyond.

    THE BLIND WEBSTER
      It is not necessary to understand; it is enough to
adore.
  The god may be of clay: adore him; he becomes
    GOD.
      We ignore what created us; we adore what we create.
Let us create nothing but GOD!
  That which causes us to create is our true father and
    mother; we create in our own image, which is theirs.
      Let us create therefore without fear; for we can
create nothing that is not GOD.
  [52]
    COMMENTARY ({Kappa-Alpha})
      The 21st key of the Tarot is called "The Universe",
and refers to the letter Tau, the Phallus in manifesta-
  tion; hence the title, "The Blind Webster".
    The universe is conceived as Buddhists, on the one
      hand, and Rationalists, on the other, would have us do;
fatal, and without intelligence.  Even so, it may be
  delightful to the creator.
    The moral of this chapter is, therefore, and exposition
      of the last paragraph of Chapter 18.
It is the critical spirit which is the Devil, and gives
  rise to the appearance of evil.

  THE DESPOT
    The waiters of the best eating-houses mock the whole
      world; they estimate every client at his proper
value.
  This I know certainly, because they always treat me
    with profound respect.  Thus they have flattered
      me into praising them thus publicly.
Yet it is true; and they have this insight because
  they serve, and because they can have no personal
    interest in the affairs of those whom they serve.
      An absolute monarch would be absolutely wise and
good.
  But no man is strong enough to have no interest.
    Therefore the best king would be Pure Chance.
      It is Pure Chance that rules the Universe; therefore,
and only therefore, life is good.

    And so at last get OUT.
      [56]
COMMENTARY ({Kappa-Gamma})
  Both "23" and "Skidoo" are American words
    meaning "Get out".  This chapter describes the Great
      Work under the figure of a man ridding himself of all
his accidents.
  He first leaves the life of comfort; then the world at
    large; and, lastly, even the initiates.
      In the fourth section is shown that there is no return
for one that has started on this path.
  The word OUT is then analysed, and treated as a
    noun.
      Besides the explanation in the note, O is the Yoni;
T, the Lingam; and U, the Hierophant; the 5th card
  of the Tarot, the Pentagram.  It is thus practically
    identical with IAO.
      The rest of the chapter is clear, for the note.
NOTES
  (12) O = {character?}, "The Devil of the Sabbath".  U = 8,
    the Hierophant or Redeemer.  T = Strength, the Lion.
      (13) T, manhood, the sign of the cross or phallus.
UT, the Holy Guardian Angel; UT, the first syllable
  of Udgita, see the Upanishads.  O, Nothing or Nuit.

    This book would translate Beyond-Reason into the
      words of Reason.
Explain thou snow to them of Andaman.
  The slaves of reason call this book Abuse-of-
    Language: they are right.
      Language was made for men to eat and drink, make
love, do barter, die.  The wealth of a language con-
  sists in its Abstracts; the poorest tongues have
    wealth of Concretes.
      Therefore have Adepts praised silence; at least it
does not mislead as speech does.
  Also, Speech is a symptom of Thought.
    Yet, silence is but the negative side of Truth; the
      positive side is beyond even silence.
Nevertheless, One True God crieth hriliu!
  And the laughter of the Death-rattle is akin.

The Hawk is the symbol of sight; the Blindworm, of

      25 is the square of 5, and the Pentagram has the

    The Second, who is the Fourth, the Demiurge, whom
      all nations of Men call The First, is a lie grafted
upon a lie, a lie multiplied by a lie.
  Fourfold is He, the Elephant upon whom the
    Universe is poised: but the carapace of the
      Tortoise supports and covers all.
This Tortoise is sixfold, the Holy Hexagram.(15)
  These six and four are ten, 10, the One manifested
    that returns into the Naught unmanifest.
      The All-Mighty, the All-Ruler, the All-Knower, the
All-Father, adored by all men and by me
  abhorred, be thou accursed, be thou abolished, be
    thou annihilated, Amen!
      [62]
COMMENTARY ({Kappa-Digamma})
  The title of the chapter refers to the Hindu legend.
    The first paragraph should be read in connection
      with our previous remarks upon the number 91.
The number of the chapter, 26, is that of Tetra-
  grammaton, the manifest creator, Jehovah.
    He is called the Second in relation to that which is
      above the Abyss, comprehended under the title of the
First.
  But the vulgarians conceive of nothing beyond the
    creator, and therefore call him The First.
      He is really the Fourth, being in Chesed, and of
course his nature is fourfold.  This Four is conceived
  of as the Dyad multiplied by the Dyad; falsehood con-
    firming falsehood.
      Paragraph 3 introduces a new conception; that of
the square within the hexagram, the universe enclosed
  in the law of Lingam-Yoni.
    The penultimate paragraph shows the redemption of
      the universe by this law.
The figure 10, like the work IO, again suggest
  Lingam-Yoni, besides the exclamation given in the
    text.
      The last paragraph curses the universe thus un-
redeemed.
  The eleven initial A's in the last sentence are Magick
    Pentagrams, emphasising this curse.

  of 60 Degrees.

      was none that did not instantly obey his bidding.
In the whole system of ten million times ten million

      be interpreted on all planes.
But in this chapter, little hint is given of anything
  beyond physical love.  It is called the Pole-Star, because

      Note that the word Laylah is the Arabic for "Night".

  So that IT does neither of these things.  IT does
    THAT one thing which we must express by two
      things neither of which possesses any rational
meaning.
  Yet ITS doing, which is no-doing, is simple and yet
    complex, is neither free nor necessary.
      For all these ideas express Relation; and IT, com-
prehending all Relation in ITS simplicity, is out of
  all Relation even with ITSELF.
    All this is true and false; and it is true and false to
      say that it is true and false.
Strain forth thine Intelligence, O man, O worthy
  one, O chosen of IT, to apprehend the discourse
    of THE MASTER; for thus thy reason shall at
      last break down, as the fetter is struck from a
slave's throat.

    COMMENTARY ({Lambda-Alpha})
      The number 31 refers to the Hebrew word LA, which
means "not".
  A new character is now introduce under the title of
    IT, I being the secret, and T being the manifested,
      phallus.
This is, however, only one aspect of IT, which may
  perhaps be defined as the Ultimate Reality.
    IT is apparently a more exalted thing than THAT.
      This chapter should be compared with Chapter 11;
that method of destroying the reason by formulating
  contradictions is definitely inculcated.
    The reason is situated in Daath, which corresponds
      the the throat in human anatomy.  Hence the title of the
chapter, "The Garotte".
  The idea is that, by forcing the mind to follow, and
    as far as possible to realise, the language of Beyond
      the Abyss, the student will succeed in bringing his
reason under control.
  As soon as the reason is vanquished, the garotte is
    removed; then the influence of the supernals (Kether,
      Chokmah, Binah), no longer inhibited by Daath, can
descend upon Tiphareth, where the human will is
  situated, and flood it with the ineffable light.

    It is a practical instruction, the gist of which is
      easily to be apprehended by comparatively short practice
of Mantra-Yoga.

COMMENTARY ({Lambda-Gamma})
  33 is the number of the Last Degree of Masonry,
    which was conferred upon Frater P. in the year 1900
      of the vulgar era by Don Jesus de Medina-Sidonia in
the City of Mexico.
  Baphomet is the mysterious name of the God of the
    Templars.
      The Eagle described in paragraph 1 is that of the
Templars.
  This Masonic symbol is, however, identified by
    Frater P. with a bird, which is master of the four
      elements, and therefore of the name Tetragrammaton.
Jacobus Burgundus Molensis suffered martyrdom
  in the City of Paris in the year 1314 of the vulgar era.
    The secrets of his order were, however, not lost, and
      are still being communicated to the worthy by his
successors, as is intimated by the last paragraph, which
  implies knowledge of a secret worship, of which the
    Grand Master did not speak.
      The Eagle may be identified, though not too closely,
with the Hawk previously spoken of.
  It is perhaps the Sun, the exoteric object of worship
    of all sensible cults; it is not to be confused with other
      objects of the mystic aviary, such as the swan, phoenix,
pelican, dove and so on.

  This is the Comedy of Pan, that man should think

      This is the Tragedy of Man when facing Love and
Death he turns to bay.  He is no more hare, but

  COMMENTARY ({Lambda-Epsilon})
    This chapter must be read in connection with
      Chapters 1, 3, 4, 8, 15, 16, 18, 24, 28, 29.
The last sentence of paragraph 4 also connects with
  the first paragraph of Chapter 26.
    The title "Venus of Milo" is an argument in support
      of paragraphs 1 and 2, it being evident from this
statement that the female body becomes beautiful in so
  far as it approximates to the male.
    The female is to be regarded as having been separated
      from the male, in order to reproduce the male in a
superior form, the absolute, and the conditions forming
  the one absolute.
    In the last two paragraphs there is a justification of
      a practice which might be called sacred prostitution.
In the common practice of meditation the idea is to
  reject all impressions, but here is an opposite practice,
    very much more difficult, in which all are accepted.
      This cannot be done at all unless one is capable of
making Dhyana at least on any conceivable thing, at
  a second's notice; otherwise, the practice would only
    be ordinary mind-wandering.

      Let the Adept be armed with his Magick Rood [and
provided with his Mystic Rose].
  In the centre, let him give the L.V.X. signs; or if
    he know them, if he will and dare do them, and
      can keep silent about them, the signs of N.O.X.
being the signs of Puer, Vir, Puella, Mulier.  Omit
  the sign I.R.
    Then let him advance to the East, and make the
      Holy Hexagram, saying: PATER ET MATER
UNIS DEUS ARARITA.
  Let him go round to the South, make the Holy
    Hexagram, and say: MATER ET FILIUS UNUS

Let him go round to the West, make the Holy

    Let him then return to the Centre, and so to The
      Centre of All [making the ROSY CROSS as he
may know how] saying: ARARITA ARARITA
  ARARITA.
    In this the Signs shall be those of Set Triumphant
      and of Baphomet.  Also shall Set appear in the
Circle.  Let him drink of the Sacrament and let him
  communicate the same.]
    Then let him say: OMNIA IN DUOS: DUO IN

  Let him then repeat the signs of L.V.X. but not the

      Both eclipses are darkness; both are exceeding rare;

  [84]
    COMMENTARY ({Lambda-Zeta})
      Dragons are in the East supposed to cause eclipses
by devouring the luminaries.
  There may be some significance in the chapter
    number, which is that of Jechidah the highest unity of
      the soul.
In this chapter, the idea is given that all limitation
  and evil is an exceedingly rare accident; there can be
    no night in the whole of the Solar System, except in rare
      spots, where the shadow of a planet is cast by itself.
It is a serious misfortune that we happen to live in a
  tiny corner of the system, where the darkness reaches such
    a high figure as 50 per cent.
      The same is true of moral and spiritual conditions.

THE LOOBY
  Only loobies find excellence in these words.
    It is thinkable that A is not-A; to reverse this is but
      to revert to the normal.
Yet by forcing the brain to accept propositions of
  which one set is absurdity, the other truism, a
    new function of brain is established.
      Vague and mysterious and all indefinite are the
contents of this new consciousness; yet they are
  somehow vital.  by use they become luminous.
    Unreason becomes Experience.
      This lifts the leaden-footed soul to the Experience
of THAT of which Reason is the blasphemy.
  But without the Experience these words are the
    Lies of a Looby.
      Yet a Looby to thee, and a Booby to me, a Balassius
Ruby to GOD, may be!
  [88]
    COMMENTARY ({Lambda-Theta})
      The word Looby occurs in folklore, and was supposed
to be the author, at the time of writing this book, which
  he did when he was far from any standard works of
    reference, to connote partly "booby", partly "lout".
      It would thus be a similar word to "Parsifal".
Paragraphs 2-6 explain the method that was given
  in Chapters 11 and 31.  This method, however, occurs
    throughout the book on numerous occasions, and even
      in the chapter itself it is employed in the last paragraphs.

      THE HIMOG(19)
A red rose absorbs all colours but red; red is therefore
  the one colour that it is not.
    This Law, Reason, Time, Space, all Limitation blinds
      us to the Truth.
All that we know of Man, Nature, God, is just that
  which they are not; it is that which they throw off
    as repungnant.
      The HIMOG is only visible in so far as He is imperfect.
Then are they all glorious who seem not to be glorious,
  as the HIMOG is All-glorious Within?
    It may be so.
      How then distinguish the inglorious and perfect
HIMOG from the inglorious man of earth?
  Distinguish not!
    But thyself Ex-tinguish: HIMOG art thou, and
      HIMOG shalt thou be.
[90]
  COMMENTARY ({MU})
    Paragraph 1 is, of course, a well-known scientific
      fact.
In paragraph 2 it is suggested analogically that all
  thinkable things are similarly blinds for the Unthinkable
    Reality.
      Classing in this manner all things as illusions, the
question arises as to the distinguishing between illusions;
  how are we to tell whether a Holy Illuminated Man of
    God is really so, since we can see nothing of him but
      his imperfections. :It may be yonder beggar is a King."
But these considerations are not to trouble such mind
  as the Chela may possess; let him occupy himself,
    rather, with the task of getting rid of his personality;
      this, and not criticism of his holy Guru, should be the
occupation of his days and nights.

  [92]
    COMMENTARY ({Mu-Alpha})
      the title is only partially explained i the note; it
means that the statements in this chapter are to be
  understood in the most ordinary and commonplace
    way, without any mystical sense.
      V.V.V.V.V. is the motto of a Master of the Temple
(or so much He disclosed to the Exempt Adepts),
  referred to in Liber LXI.  It is he who is responsible
    for the whole of the development of the A,'.A.'. move-
      ment which has been associated with the publication of
THE EQUINOX; and His utterance is enshrined in
  the sacred writings.
    It is useless to enquire into His nature; to do so leads
      to certain disaster.  Authority from him is exhibited,
when necessary, to the proper persons, though in no
  case to anyone below the grade of Exempt Adept.  The
    person enquiring into such matters is politely requested
      to work, and not to ask questions about matters which
in no way concern him.

  The Stars are but thistles in that waste.
    Yet this desert is but one spot accursed in a world of

Now and again Travellers cross the desert; they come
  from the Great Sea, and to the Great Sea they go.
    As they go they spill water; one day they will irrigate
      the desert, till it flower.
See! five footprints of a Camel! V.V.V.V.V.
  [94]
    COMMENTARY ({Mu-Beta})
      This number 42 is the Great Number of the Curse.  See Liber
418, Liber 500, and the essay on the Qabalah in the Temple of
  Solomon the King.  This number is said to be all hotch-potch and
    accursed.
      The chapter should be read most carefully in connection with
the 10th Aethyr.  It is to that dramatic experience that it refers.
  The mind is called "wind", because of its nature; as has been
    frequently explained, the ideas and words are identical.
      In this free-flowing, centreless material arises an eddy; a
spiral close-coiled upon itself.
  The theory of the formation of the Ego is that of the Hindus,
    whose Ahamkara is itself a function of the mind, whose ego it
      creates.  This Ego is entirely divine.
Zoroaster describes God as having the head of the Hawk, and
  a spiral force.  It will be difficult to understand this chapter with-
    out some experience in the transvaluation of values, which occurs
      throughout the whole of this book, in nearly every other sentence.
Transvaluation of values is only the moral aspect of the method
  of contradiction.
    The word "turbulence" is applied to the Ego to suggest the
      French "tourbillion", whirlwind, the false Ego or dust-devil.
True life, the life, which has no consciousness of "I", is said to
  be choked by this false ego, or rather by the thoughts which its
    explosions produce.  In paragraph 4 this is expanded to a
      macrocosmic plane.
The Masters of the Temple are now introduced; they are
  inhabitants, not of this desert; their abode is not this universe.
    They come from the Great Sea, Binah, the City of the Pyramids.
      V.V.V.V.V. is indicated as one of these travellers; He is
described as a camel, not because of the connotation of the French
  form of this word, but because "camel" is in hebrew Gimel, and
    Gimel is the path leading from Tiphareth to Kether, uniting
      Microprosopus and Macroprosopus, i.e. performing the Great
Work.
  The card Gimel in the Tarot is the High Priestess, the Lady of
    Initiation; one might even say, the Holy Guardian Angel.

  Black blood of the sweet fruit, the bruised, the
    violated bloom-that setteth The Wheel a-spinning
      in the spire.
Death is the veil of Life, and Life of Death; for both
  are Gods.

      a greater feast for Death!" in THE BOOK OF
THE LAW.
  The blood is the life of the individual: offer then
    blood!
      [96]
COMMENTARY ({Mu-Gamma})
  The title of this chapter refers to a Hebrew legend,
    that of the prophet who heard "a going in the mulberry
      tops"; and to Browning's phrase, "a bruised, black-
blooded mulberry".
  In the World's Tragedy, Household Gods, The
    Scorpion, and also The God-Eater, the reader may
      study the efficacy of rape, and the sacrifice of blood, as
magical formulae.  Blood and virginity have always
  been the most acceptable offerings to all the gods, but
    especially the Christian God.
      In the last paragraph, the reason of this is explained;
it is because such sacrifices come under the Great Law
  of the Rosy Cross, the giving-up of the individuality,
    as has been explained as nauseam in previous chapters.
      We shall frequently recur to this subject.
By "the wheel spinning in the spire" is meant the
  manifestation of magical force, the spermatozoon in the
    conical phallus.  For wheels, see Chapter 78.

    THE MASS OF THE PHOENIX
      The Magician, his breast bare, stands before an altar
on which are his Burin, Bell, Thurible, and two
  of the Cakes of Light.  In the Sign of the Enterer he
    reaches West across the Altar, and cries:
      Hail Ra, that goest in Thy bark
Into the Caverns of the DarK!
  He gives the sign of Silence, and takes the Bell, and
    Fire, in his hands.
      East of the Altar see me stand
With Light and Musick in mine hand!
  He strikes Eleven times upon the Bell 3 3 3-5 5 5 5 5-
    3 3 3 and places the Fire in the Thurible.
      I strike the Bell: I light the flame:
I utter the mysterious Name.

      Now I begin to pray: Thou Child,
holy Thy name and undefiled!
  Thy reign is come: Thy will is done.
    Here is the Bread; here is the Blood.
      Bring me through midnight to the Sun!
Save me from Evil and from Good!
  That Thy one crown of all the Ten.
    Even now and here be mine. AMEN.
      He puts the first Cake on the Fire of the Thurible.
I burn the Incense-cake, proclaim
  These adorations of Thy name.
    He makes them as in Liber Legis, and strikes again
      Eleven times upon the Bell.  With the Burin he then
makes upon his breast the proper sign.
  [98]
    Behold this bleeding breast of mine
      Gashed with the sacramental sign!
He puts the second Cake to the wound.
  I stanch the blood; the wager soaks
    It up, and the high priest invokes!
      He eats the second Cake.
This Bread I eat.  This Oath I swear
  As I enflame myself with prayer:
    "There is no grace: there is no guilt:
      This is the Law: DO WHAT THOU WILT!"
He strikes Eleven times upon the Bell, and cries
  ABRAHADABRA.
    I entered in with woe; with mirth
      I now go forth, and with thanksgiving,
To do my pleasure on the earth
  Among the legions of the living.
    He goeth forth.
      COMMENTARY ({Mu-Delta})
This is the special number of Horus; it is the Hebrew
  blood, and the multiplication of the 4 by the 11, the
    number of Magick, explains 4 in its finest sense.  But
      see in particular the accounts in Equinox I, vii of the
circumstances of the Equinox of the Gods.
  The word "Phoenix" may be taken as including the
    idea of "Pelican", the bird, which is fabled to feeds its
      young from the blood of its own breast.  Yet the two
ideas, though cognate, are not identical, and "Phoenix"
  is the more accurate symbol.
    This chapter is explained in Chapter 62.
      It would be improper to comment further upon a
ritual which has been accepted as official by the

[100]
  COMMENTARY ({Mu-Epsilon})
    The title of this chapter is drawn from paragraph 7.
      We now, for the first time, attack the question of
doubt.
  "Th Soldier and the Hunchback" should be care-
    fully studied in this connection.  The attitude recom-
      mended is scepticism, but a scepticism under control.
Doubt inhibits action, as much as faith binds it.  All
  the best Popes have been Atheists, but perhaps the
    greatest of them once remarked, "Quantum nobis
      prodest haec fabula Christi".
The ruler asserts facts as they are; the slave has there-
  fore no option but to deny them passionately, in order
    to express his discontent.  Hence such absurdities as
      "Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite", "In God we trust", and
the like.  Similarly we find people asserting today that
  woman is superior to man, and that all men are born
    equal.
      The Master (in technical language, the Magus) does
not concern himself with facts; he does not care whether
  a thing is true or not: he uses truth and falsehood in-
    discriminately, to serve his ends.  Slaves consider him
      immoral, an preach against him in Hyde Park.
In paragraphs 7 and 8 we find a most important
  statement, a practical aspect of the fact that all truth
    is relative, and in the last paragraph we see how
      scepticism keeps the mind fresh, whereas faith dies in
the very sleep that it induces.

  The cause of sorrow is the desire of the One to the
    Many, or of the Many to the One.  This also is the
      cause of joy.
But the desire of one to another is all of sorrow; its
  birth is hunger, and its death satiety.
    The desire of the moth for the star at least saves him
      satiety.
Hunger thou, O man, for the infinite: be insatiable
  even for the finite; thus at The End shalt thou
    devour the finite, and become the infinite.
      Be thou more greedy that the shark, more full of
yearning than the wind among the pines.
  The weary pilgrim struggles on; the satiated pilgrim
    stops.
      The road winds uphill: all law, all nature must be
overcome.
  Do this by virtue of THAT in thyself before which
    law and nature are but shadows.
      [102]
COMMENTARY ({Mu-Digamma})
  The title of this chapter is best explained by a refer-
    ence to Mistinguette and Mayol.
      It would be hard to decide, and it is fortunately un-
necessary even to discuss, whether the distinction of
  their art is the cause, result, or concomitant of their
    private peculiarities.
      The fact remains that in vice, as in everything else,
some things satiate, others refresh.  Any game in which
  perfection is easily attained soon ceases to amuse,
    although in the beginning its fascination is so violent.
      Witness the tremendous, but transitory, vogue of
ping-pong and diabolo.  Those games in which per-
  fection is impossible never cease to attract.
    The lesson of the chapter is thus always to rise
      hungry from a meal, always to violate on's own nature.
Keep on acquiring a taste for what is naturally
  repugnant; this is an unfailing source of pleasure, and
    it has a real further advantage, in destroying the
      Sankharas, which, however "good" in themselves,
relatively to other Sankharas, are yet barriers upon the
  Path; they are modifications of the Ego, and therefore
    those things which bar it from the absolute.

COMMENTARY ({Mu-Zeta})
  The allusion in the title is not quite clear, though it
    may be connected with the penultimate paragraph.
      The chapter consists of two points of view from which
to regard Yoga, two odes upon a distant prospect of the
  Temple of Madura, two Elegies on a mat of Kusha-
    grass.
      The penultimate paragraph is introduced by way of
repose. Cynicism is a great cure for over-study.
  There is a great deal of cynicism in this book, in one
    place and another.  It should be regarded as Angostura
      Bitters, to brighten the flavour of a discourse which
were else too sweet.  It prevents one from slopping over

This is the Seal upon the Ring that is on the Fore-

    them whom She hath slain.

      [108]
COMMENTARY ({Mu-theta})
  49 is the square of 7.
    7 is the passive and feminine number.
      The chapter should be read in connection with Chapter 31
for IT now reappears.
  The chapter heading, the Waratah, is a voluptuous scarlet
    flower, common in Australia, and this connects the chapter
      with Chapters 28 and 29; but this is only an allusion, for
the subject of the chapter is OUR LADY BABALON,
  who is conceived as the feminine counterpart of IT.
    This does not agree very well with the common or orthodox
      theogony of Chapter 11; but it is to be explained by the
dithyrambic nature of the chapter.
  In paragraph 3 NO MAN is of course NEMO, the
    Master of the Temple, Liber 418 will explain most of the
      allusions in this chapter.
In paragraphs 5 and 6 the author frankly identifies him-
  self with the BEAST referred to in the book, and in the
    Apocalypse, and in LIBER LEGIS.  In paragraph 6 the
      word "angel" may refer to his mission, and the word
"lion-serpent" to the sigil of his ascending decan. (Teth=
  Snake=spermatozoon and Leo in the Zodiac, which like
    Teth itself has the snake-form.  theta first written {Sun} = Lingam-
      Yoni and Sol.)
Paragraph 7 explains the theological difficulty referred
  to above.  There is only one symbol, but this symbol has
    many names: of those names BABALON is the holiest.
      It is the name referred to in Liber Legis, 1, 22.
It will be noticed that the figure, or sigil, of BABALON
  is a seal upon a ring, and this ring is upon the forefinger
    of IT.  This identifies further the symbol with itself.
      It will be noticed that this seal, except for the absence of
a border, is the official seal of the A.'.A.'. Compare Chapter
  3.
    It is also said to be the seal upon the tombs of them that
      she hath slain, that is, of the Masters of the Temple.
In connection with the number 49, see Liber 418, the
  22nd Aethyr, as well as the usual authorities.

  THE VIGIL OF ST. HUBERT
    In the forest God met the Stag-beetle.  "Hold!  Wor-
      ship me!" quoth God.  "For I am All-Great, All-
Good, All Wise....The stars are but sparks from
  the forges of My smiths...."
    "Yea, verily and Amen," said the Stag-beetle, "all
      this do I believe, and that devoutly."
"Then why do you not worship Me?"
  "Because I am real and your are only imaginary."
    But the leaves of the forest rustled with the laughter
      of the wind.
Said Wind and Wood: "They neither of them know
  anything!"
    [110]
      COMMENTARY ({Nu})
St. Hubert appears to have been a saint who saw a
  stag of a mystical or sacred nature.
    The Stag-beetle must not be identified with the one
      in Chapter 16.  It is a merely literary touch.
the chapter is a resolution of the universe into
  Tetragrammaton; God the macrocosm and the micro-
    cosm beetle.  Both imagine themselves to exist; both say
      "you" and "I", and discuss their relative reality.
The things which really exist, the things which have
  no Ego, and speak only in the third person, regard
    these as ignorant, on account of their assumption of
      Knowledge.

  [112]
    COMMENTARY ({Nu-Alpha})
      The number 51 means failure and pain, and its
subject is appropriately doubt.
  The title of the chapter is borrowed from the health-
    giving and fascinating sport of fox-hunting, which
      Frater Perdurabo followed in his youth.
This chapter should be read in connection with "The
  Soldier and the Hunchback" of which it is in some sort
    an epitome.
      Its meaning is sufficiently clear, but in paragraphs
6 and 7 it will be noticed that the identification of the
  Soldier with the Hunchback has reached such a pitch
    that the symbols are interchanged, enthusiasm being
      represented as the sinuous snake, scepticism as the
Goat of the Sabbath.  In other words, a state is reached
  in which destruction is as much joy as creation.
    (Compare Chapter 46.)
      Beyond that is a still deeper state of mind, which is
THAT.

THE BULL-BAITING
  Fourscore and eleven books wrote I; in each did I
    expound THE GREAT WORK fully, from The
      beginning even unto The End thereof.
Then at last came certain men unto me, saying:
  O Master!  Expound thou THE GREAT WORK
    unto us, O Master!
      And I held my peace.
O generation of gossipers!  who shall deliver you
  from the Wrath that is fallen upon you?
    O Babblers, Prattlers, Talkers, Loquacious Ones,
      Tatlers, Chewers of the Red Rag that inflameth
Apis the Redeemer to fury, learn first what is
  Work!  and THE GREAT WORK is not so far
    beyond!
      [114]
COMMENTARY ({Nu-Beta})
  52 is BN, the number of the Son, Osiris-Apis, the
    Redeemer, with whom the Master (Fra. P.) identifies
      himself.  he permits himself for a moment the pleasure
of feeling his wounds; and, turning upon his generation,
  gores it with his horns.
    The fourscore-and-eleven books do not, we think,
      refer to the ninety-one chapters of this little master-
piece, or even to the numerous volumes he has penned,
  but rather to the fact that 91 is the number of Amen,
    implying the completeness of his work.
      In the last paragraph is a paranomasia.  "To chew
the red rag" is a phrase for to talk aimlessly and per-
  sistently, while it is notorious that a red cloth will excite
    the rage of a bull.

    THE DOWSER
      Once round the meadow.  Brother, does the hazel
twig dip?
  Twice round the orchard.  Brother, does the hazel
    twig dip?
      Thrice round the paddock, Highly, lowly, wily, holy,
dip, dip, dip!
  Then neighed the horse in the paddock-and lo!
    its wings.
      For whoso findeth the SPRING beneath the earth
maketh the treaders-of-earth to course the heavens.
  This SPRING is threefold; of water, but also of steel,
    and of the seasons.
      Also this PADDOCK is the Toad that hath the
jewel between his eyes-Aum Mani Padmen
  Hum! (Keep us from Evil!)
    [116]
      COMMENTARY ({Nu-Gamma})
A dowser is one who practises divination, usually with
  the object of finding water or minerals, by means of the
    vibrations of a hazel twig.
      The meadow represents the flower of life; the orchard its
fruit.
  The paddock, being reserved for animals, represents life
    itself.  That is to say, the secret spring of life is found in the
      place of life, with the result that the horse, who represents
ordinary animal life, becomes the divine horse Pegasus.
  In paragraph 6 we see this spring identified with the
    phallus, for it is not only a source of water, but highly
      elastic, while the reference to the seasons alludes to the well-
known lines of the late Lord Tennyson:
  "In the spring a livelier iris changes on the burnished dove,
    In the Spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts
      of love."
-Locksley Hall.
  In paragraph 7 the place of life, the universe of animal
    souls, is identified with the toad, which
      "Ugly and venomous,
Wears yet a precious jewel in his head"
  -Romeo and Juliet-
    this jewel being the divine spark in man, and indeed in all
      that "lives and moves and has its being".  Note this phrase,
which is highly significant; the word "lives" excluding the
  mineral kingdom, the word "moves" the vegetable kingdom,
    and the phrase "has its being" the lower animals, including
      woman.
This "toad" and "jewel" are further identified with the
  Lotus and jewel of the well-known Buddhist phrase and
    this seems to suggest that this "toad" is the Yoni; the
      suggestion is further strengthened by the concluding phrase
in brackets, "Keep us from evil", since, although it is the
  place of life, the means of grace, it may be ruinous.

  [118]
    COMMENTARY ({Nu-Delta})
      The title of this chapter refers to the duty of the Tyler
in a blue lodge of Freemasons.
  The numbers in paragraphs 1 to 3 are significant;
    each Master-Mason is attended by 5 Fellow-Crafts,
      and each Fellow-Craft by 3 Apprentices, as if the
Masters were sitting in pentagrams, and the Fellow-
  Craftsmen in triangles.  This may refer to the number of
    manual signs in each of these degrees.
      The moral of the chapter is apparently that the
mother-letter {Aleph} is an inadequate solution of the Great
  Problem.  {Aleph} is identified with the Yoni, for all the
    symbols connected with it in this place are feminine,
      but {Aleph} is also a number of Samadhi and mysticism, and
the doctrine is therefore that Magick, in that highest
  sense explained in the Book of the Law, is the truer
    key.

[120]
  COMMENTARY ({Nu-Epsilon})
    The number 55 refers to Malkuth, the ride; it
      should then be read in connection with Chapters 28, 29,
49.
  The "drooping sunflower" is the heart, which needs
    the divine light.
      Since Jivatma was separated from Paramatma, as
in paragraph 2, not only is the Divine Unity destroyed
  but Daath, instead of being the Child of Chokmah and
    Binah, becomes the Abyss, and the Qliphoth arise.
      The only sense which abides is that of loss, and the
craving to retrieve it.  In paragraph 3 it is seen that this
  is impossible, owing (paragraph 4) to his not having
    made proper arrangements to recover the original
      position previous to making the divisions.
In paragraph 5 it is shown that this is because of
  allowing enjoyment to cause forgetfulness of the really
    important thing.  Those who allow themselves to wallow
      in Samadhi are sorry for it afterwards.
The last paragraph indicaed the precautions to be
  taken to avoid this.
    The number 90 is the last paragraph is not merely
      fact, but symbolism; 90 being the number of Tzaddi,
the Star, looked at in its exoteric sense, as a naked
  woman, playing by a stream, surrounded by birds and
    butterflies.  The pole-axe is recommended instead of
      the usual razor, as a more vigorous weapon.  One
cannot be too severe in checking any faltering in the
  work, any digression from the Path.

      [122]
COMMENTARY ({Nu-Digamma})
  The number of the chapter refers to Liber Legis I, 24,
    for paragraph 1 refers to Nuit.  The "twins" in the
      title are those mentioned in paragraph 5.
555 is HADIT, HAD spelt in full.  156 is
  BABALON.
    In paragraph 4 is the gist of the chapter, Laylah
      being again introduced, as in Chapters 28, 29, 49 and
55.
  The exoteric blasphemy, it is hinted i the last
    paragraph, may be an esoteric arcanum, for the Master
      of the Temple is interested in Malkuth, as Malkuth is
in Binah; also "Malkuth is in Kether, and Kether in
  Malkuth"; and, to the Ipsissimus, dissolution in the
    body of Nuit and a visit to a brothel may be identical.

    THE DUCK-BILLED PLATYPUS

    And worship Him that swore by His holy T that One
      should not be One except in so far as it is Two.
I am glad that LAYLAH is afar; no doubt clouds
  love.
    [124]
      COMMENTARY ({Nu-Zeta})
The title of the chapter suggest the two in one, since
  the ornithorhynchus is both bird and beast; it is also
    an Australian animal, like Laylah herself, and was
      doubtless chosen for this reason.
This chapter is an apology for the universe.
  Paragraphs 1-3 repeat the familiar arguments
    against reason in an epigrammatic form.
      Paragraph 4 alludes to Liber Legis I, 52; "place"
implies space; denies homogeneity to space; but when
  "place" is perfected by "t"-as it were, Yoni by Lingam
    -we get the word "placet", meaning "it pleases".
      Paragraphs 6 and 7 explain this further; it is
necessary to separate things, in order that they might
  rejoice in uniting.  See Liber Legis I, 28-30, which is
    paraphrased in the penultimate paragraph.
      In the last paragraph this doctrine is interpreted
in common life by a paraphrase of the familiar and
  beautiful proverb,  "Absence makes the heart grow
    fonder".  (PS. I seem to get a subtle after-taste of
      bitterness.)
(It is to be observed that the philosopher having first
  committed the syllogistic error quaternis terminorum,
    in attempting to reduce the terms to three, staggers into
      non distributia medii.  It is possible that considerations
with Sir Wm. Hamilton's qualification (or quantifica-
  tion (?)) of the predicate may be taken as intervening,
    but to do so would render the humour of the chapter too
      subtle for the average reader in Oshkosh for whom
this book is evidently written.)

  COMMENTARY ({Nu-Eta})
    Haggai, a notorious Hebrew prophet, is a Second
      Officer in a Chapter of the Royal Arch Masons.
In this chapter the author, in a sort of raging
  eloquence, bewails his impotence to express himself,
    or to induce others to follow into the light.  In para-
      graph 1 he explains the sardonic laughter, for which he
is justly celebrated, as being in reality the expression of
  this feeling.
    Paragraph 2 is a reference to the Obligation of an
      Entered Apprentice Mason.
Paragraph 3 refers to the Ceremony of Exaltation
  in Royal Arch Masonry.  The Initiate will be able to
    discover the most formidable secret of that degree con-
      cealed in the paragraph.
Paragraphs 4-6 express an anguish to which that of
  Gethsemane and Golgotha must appear like whitlows.
    In paragraph 7 the agony is broken up by the
      sardonic or cynical laughter to which we have previously
alluded.
  And the final paragraph, in the words of the noblest
    simplicity, praises the Great Work; rejoices in its
      sublimity, in the supreme Art, in the intensity of the
passion and ecstasy which it brings forth.  (Note that
  the words "passion" and "ecstasy" may be taken as
    symbolical of Yoni and Lingam.)

  The chapter is a short essay in poetic form on

  on their own circumstances.  The sufferer from toothache

      The title is explained in the note.
The number of the chapter may refer to the letter

    I paragraph 1 the real chastity of Percivale or
      Parsifal, a chastity which did not prevent his dipping
the point of the sacred lance into the Holy Grail, is
  distinguished from its misinterpretation by modern
    crapulence.  The priests of the gods were carefully
      chosen, and carefully trained to fulfill the sacrament of
fatherhood; the shame of sex consists in the usurpation
  of its function by the unworthy.  Sex is a sacrament.
    The word virtus means "the quality of manhood".
      Modern "virtue" is the negation of all such qualities.
In paragraph 3, however, we see the penalty of
  conservatism; children must be weaned.
    In the penultimate paragraph the words "the new
      Christ" alluded to the author.
In the last paragraph we reach the sublime mystic
  doctrine that whatever you have must be abandoned.
    Obviously, that which differentiates your consciousness
      from the absolute is part of the content of that con-
sciousness.

  [132]
    COMMENTARY ({Xi-Alpha})
      The number of this chapter refers to the Hebrew word Ain, the negative and
Ani, 61.
  The "fool" is the Fool of the Tarot, whose number is 0, but refers the the le
    tter
      Aleph, 1.
A fool's knot is a kind of knot which, although it has the appearance of a kn
  ot, is
    not really a knot, but pulls out immediately.
      The chapter consists of a series of complicated puns on 1 and I, with regard
to
  their shape, sound, and that of the figures which resemble them in shape.
    Paragraph 1 calls upon the Fool of the Tarot, who is to be referred to Ipsiss
      imus,
to the pure fool, Parsifal, to resolve this problem.
  The word Naught-y suggests not only that the problem is sexual, but does not
    really
      exist.
Paragraph 2 shows the Lingam and Yoni as, in conjunction, the foundation of
  ecstasy (I)!), and of the complete symbol I A O.
    The latter sentence of the paragraph unites the two meanings of giving up the
      Lingam to the Yoni, and the Ego to the Absolute.
This idea, "I must give up", I owe, is naturally completed by I pay, and the
  sound of the word "pay" suggest the Hebrew letter Pe (see Liber XVI), which
    represents the final dissolution in Shivadarshana.
      I Hebrew, the letter which follows O is P; i therefore follows Ayin, the Devi
l
  of the Tarot.
    AYIN is spelt O I N, thus replacing the A in A I N by an O, the letter of the
      Devil, or Pan, the phallic God.
Now AIN means nothing, and thus the replacing of AIN by OIN means the
  completion of the Yoni by the Lingam, which is followed by the complete dissolu
    tion
      symbolised in the letter P.
These letters, O P, are then seen to be the root of opus, the Latin word for
  "work",
    in this case, the Great Work.  And they also begin the word "opening".  I hindu
      philosophy, it is said that Shiva, the Destroyer, is asleep, and that when he o
pens
  his eye the universe is destroyed-another synonym, therefore, for the accomplis
    h-
      ment of the Great Work.  But the "eye" of Shiva is also his Lingam.  Shiva is
himself the Mahalingam, which unites these symbolisms.  The opening of the eye,
  the ejaculation of the lingam, the destruction of the universe, the accomplishm
    ent
      of the Great Work-all these are different ways of saying the same thing.
The last paragraph is even obscurer to those unfamiliar to the masterpiece
  referred to in the note; for the eye of Horus (see 777, Col.
    XXI, line 10, "the blind
      eye that weeps" is a poetic Arab name for the lingam).
The doctrine is that the Great Work should be accomplished without creating n
  ew
    Karma, for the letter N, the fish, the vesica, the womb, breeds, whereas the Ey
      e of
Horus does not; or, if it does so, breeds, according to Turkish tradition, a Me
  ssiah.
    Death implies resurrection; the illusion is reborn, as the Scythe of Death in
      the
Tarot has a crosspiece.  This is in connection with the Hindu doctrine, express
  ed
    in their injunction, "Fry your seeds".  Act so as to balance your past Karma,
      and create no new, so that, as it were, the books are balanced.  WHile you have
either a credit or a debit, you are still in account with the universe.

    [136]
      COMMENTARY ({Xi-Gamma})
This chapter returns to the subject of Laylah, and
  to the subject already discussed in Chapters 3 and
    others, particularly Chapter 56.
      The title of the chapter refers to the old rime:
"See-saw, Margery Daw,
  Sold her bed to lie upon straw.
    Was not she a silly slut
      To sell her bed to lie upon dirt?"
The word "see-saw" is significant, almost a comment
  upon this chapter.  To the Master of the Temple
    opposite rules apply.  His unity seeks the many, and
      the many is again transmuted to the one.  Solve et
Coagula.

  I was discussing oysters with a crony:
    GOD sent to me the angels DIN and DONI.
      "An man of spunk," they urged, "would hardly
choose
  To breakfast every day chez Laperouse."
    "No!" I replied, "h would not do so, BUT
      Think of his woe if Laperouse were shut!
"I eat these oysters and I drink this wine
  Solely to drown this misery of mine.
    "Yet the last height of consolation's cold:
      Its pinnacle is-not to be consoled!
"And though I sleep with Janefore and Eleanor
  "And Julian only fixes in my mind
    Even before feels better than behind.
      "You are Mercurial spirits-be so kind
As to enable me to raise the wind.
  "Put me in LAYLAH'S arms again: the Accurst,
    Leaving me that. elsehow may do his worst."
      DONI and DIN, perceiving me inspired,
Conceived their task was finished: they retired.
  I turned upon my friend, and, breaking bounds,
    Borrowed a trifle of two hundred pounds.
      [138]
COMMENTARY ({Xi-Delta})
  64 is the number of Mercury, and of the intelligence
    of that planet, Din and Doni.
      Th moral of the chapter is that one wants liberty,
although one may not wish to exercise it: the author
  would readily die in defence of the right of Englishmen
    to play football, or of his own right not to play it.
      (As a great poet has expressed it: "We don't want to
fight, but, by Jingo, if we do-")  This is his meaning
  towards his attitude to complete freedom of speech and
    action.  He refuses to listen to the ostensible criticism of
      the spirits, and explains his own position.  Their real
mission was to rouse him to confidence and action.

"And in the midst of the moon-pool of silver was the
  Lily of white and gold.  In this Lily is all honey,
    in this Lily that flowereth at the midnight.  In

And it enfolded me."
  Thus the disciples that watched found a dead body

COMMENTARY ({Xi-Epsilon})
  65 is the number of Adonai, the Holy Guardian
    Angel; see Liber 65, Liber Konx Om Pax, and other
      works of reference.
The chapter title means, "So may he pass away",
  the blank obviously referring to N E M O.
    The "moon-pool of silver" is the Path of Gimel,
      leading from Tiphareth to Kether; the "flames of violet"
are the Ajna-Chakkra; the lily itself is Kether, the
  lotus of the Sahasrara.  "Lily" is spelt with a capital to
    connect with Laylah.

    THE PRAYING MANTIS
      "Say: God is One."  This I obeyed: for a thousand
and one times a night for one thousand nights and
  one did I affirm th Unity.
    But "night" only means LAYLAH(34); and Unity and
      GOD are not worth even her blemishes.
Al-lah is only sixty-six; but LAYLAH counteth
  up to Seven and Seventy.(35)
    "Yea! the night shall cover all; the night shall cover
      all."
[142]
  COMMENTARY ({Xi-Digamma})
    66 is the number of Allah; the praying mantis is a
      blasphemous grasshopper which caricatures the pious.
The chapter recurs to the subject of Laylah, whom
  the author exalts above God, in continuation of the
    reasonings given in Chapter 56 and 63.  She is
      identified with N.O.X. by the quotation from Liber 65.
NOTES
  (34) Laylah is the Arabic for night.
    (35) A L L H = 1 + 30 + 30 + 5 = 66.  L + A + I
      + L + A + H = 77, which also gives MSL, the In-
fluence of the Highest, OZ, a goat, and so on.

This chapter means that it is useless to try to abandon
  the Great Work.  You may occupy yourself for a time
    with other things, but you will only increase your
      bitterness, rivet the chains still on your feet.
Paragraph 4 is a practical counsel to mystics not
  to break up their dryness by relaxing their austerities.
    The last paragraph will only be understood by
      Masters of the Temple.

reflections:
  (1) He enjoys the advantages of solitude.  (2) Previous
    prophets encountered similar difficulties in con-
      vincing their hearers.  (3) Their food was not equal to
that obtainable at Rumpelmayer's.  (4) In a few days

      [148]
COMMENTARY ({Xi-Theta})
  The key to the understanding of this chapter is given
    in the number and the title, the former being intelligible
      to all nations who employ Arabic figures, the latter
only to experts in deciphering English puns.
  The chapter alludes to Levi's drawing of the Hexa-
    gram, and is a criticism of, or improvement upon, it.
      In the ordinary Hexagram, the Hexagram of nature,
the red triangle is upwards, like fire, and the blue
  triangle downwards, like water.  In the magical hexa-
    gram this is revered; the descending red triangle is
      that of Horus, a sign specially revealed by him per-
sonally, at the Equinox of the Gods.  (It is the flame
  desending upon the altar, and licking up the burnt
    offering.)  The blue triangle represents the aspiration,
      since blue is the colour of devotion, and the triangle,
kinetically considered, is the symbol of directed force.
  In the first three paragraphs this formation of the
    hexagram is explained; it is a symbol of the mutual
      separation of the Holy Guardian Angel and his client.
In the interlocking is indicated the completion of the
  work.
    Paragraph 4 explains in slightly different language
      what we have said above, and the scriptural image of
tongues is introduced.
  In paragraph 5 the symbolism of tongues is further
    developed.  Abrahadabra is our primal example of an
      interlocked word.  We assume that the reader has
thoroughly studied that word in Liber D., etc.  The
  sigil of Cancer links up this symbolism with the number
    of the chapter.
      The remaining paragraphs continue the Gallic
symbolism.

    70 is the number of the letter Ain, the Devil in the

The chapter refers to the Witches' Sabbath, the
  description of which in Payne Knight should be
    carefully read before studying this chapter.  All the
      allusions will then be obvious, save those which we
proceed to not.
  Sanhedrim, a body of 70 men.  An Eye.  Eye in
    Hebrew is Oin, 70.
      The "gnarled oak" and the "glacier torrent" refer
to the confessions made by many witches.

    the obscene and distorted character of much of the

[154]
  COMMENTARY ({Omicron-Beta})
    There are three consecutive verses in the Pentateuch,
      each containing 72 letters.  If these be written beneath
each other, the middle verse bring reversed, i.e. as in
  English, and divisions are then made vertically, 72
    tri-lateral names are formed, the sum of which is
      Tetragrammaton; this is the great and mysterious
Divided Name; by adding the terminations Yod He,
  or Aleph Lamed, the names of 72 Angels are formed.
    The Hebrews say that by uttering this Name the
      universe is destroyed.  This statement means the same
as that of the Hindus, that the effective utterance of
  the name of Shiva would cause him to awake, and so
    destroy the universe.
      In Egyptian and Gnostic magick we meet with pylons
and Aeons, which only open on the utterance of the
  proper word.
    In Mohammedan magick we find a similar doctrine
      and practice; and the whole of Mantra-Yoga has been
built on this foundation.
  Thoth, the god of Magick, is the inventor of speech;
    Christ is the Logos.
      Lines 1-4 are now clear.
In lines 507 we see the results of Shivadarshana.  Do
  not imagine that any single ides, however high, however
    holy (or even however insignificant!!), can escape the
      destruction.
The logician my say, "But white exists, and if
  white is destroyed, it leaves black; yet black exists.  So
    that in that case at least one known phenomenon of this
      universe is identical with one of that."  Vain word!
The logician and his logic are alike involved in the
  universal ruin.
    Lines 8-11 indicate that this fact is the essential one
      about Shivadarshana.
The title is explained by the intentionally blasphemous
  puns and colloquialisms of lines 9 and 10.

      Death rides the Camel of Initiation.(36)
Thou humped and stiff-necked one that groanest in
  Thine Asana, death will relieve thee!
    Bite not, Zelator dear, but bide!  Ten days didst
      thou go with water in thy belly?  Thou shalt go
twenty more with a firebrand at thy rump!
  Ay! all thine aspiration is to death: death is the
    crown of all thine aspiration.  Triple is the cord of
      silver moonlight; it shall hang thee, O Holy One,
O Hanged Man, O Camel-Termination-of-the-
  third-person-plural for thy multiplicity, thou
    Ghost of a Non-Ego!
      Could but Thy mother behold thee, O thou UNT!(37)
The Infinite Snake Ananta that surroundeth the
  Universe is but the Coffin-Worm!
    [156]
      COMMENTARY ({Omicron-Gamma})
The Hebrew letter Gimel adds up to 73; it means a camel.
  The title of the chapter is borrowed from the well-known lines of Rudyard
    Kipling:
      "But the commissariat camel, when all is said and done,
'E's a devil and an awstridge and an orphan-child in one."
  Paragraph 1 may imply a dogma of death as the highest form of initiation.
    Initiation is not a simple phenomenon.  Any given initiation must take place
      on several planes, and is not always conferred on all of these simultaneously.
Intellectual and moral perception of truth often, one might almost say usually,
  precedes spiritual and physical perceptions.  One would be foolish to claim
    initiation unless it were complete on every plane.
      Paragraph 2 will easily be understood by those who have practised
Asana.  there is perhaps a sardonic reference to rigor mortis, and certainly
  one conceives the half-humorous attitude of the expert towards the beginner.
    Paragraph 3 is a comment in the same tone of rough good nature.  The word
      Zelator is used because the Zelator of the A.'.A.'. has to pass an examination
in Asana before he becomes eligible for the grade of Practicus.  The ten days
  allude merely to the tradition about the camel, that he can go ten days without
    water.
      Paragraph 4 identifies the reward of initiation with death; it is a cessation
of all that we call life, in a way in which what we call death is not.  3, silv
  er,
    and  the moon, are all correspondences of Gimel, the letter of the Aspiration,
      since gimel is the Path that leads from the Microcosm in tiphareth to the
Macrocosm in Kether.
  The epithets are far too complex to explain in detail, but Mem, the Hanged
    man, has a close affinity for Gimel, as will be seen by a study of Liber 418.
      Unt is not only the Hindustani for Camel, but the usual termination of the
third person plural of the present tense of Latin words of the Third and
  Fourth Conjugations.
    The reason for thus addresing the reader is that he has now transcended the
      first and second persons.  Cf. Liber LXV, Chapter III, vv. 21-24, and
FitzGerald's Omar Khayyam:
  "Some talk there was of Thee and Me
    There seemed; and then no more of Thee and Me.")
      The third person plural must be used, because he has now perceived himself
to be a bundle of impressions.  For this is the point on the Path of Gimel when
  he is actually crossing the Abyss; the student must consult the account of this
    given in "The Temple of Solomon the King".
      The Ego is but "the ghost of a non-Ego", the imaginary focus at which the
non-Ego becomes sensible.
  Paragraph 5 expresses the wish of the Guru that his Chela may attain safely
    to binah, the Mother.
      Paragraph 6 whispers the ultimate and dread secret of initiation into his
ear, identifying the vastness of the Most Holy with the obscene worm that
  gnaws the bowels of the damned.
    NOTES
      (36) Death is said by the Arabs to ride a Camel.  The Path of Gimel (which
means a Camel) leads from Tiphareth to Kether, and its Tarot trump
  is the "High Priestess".

      When NOTHING became conscious, it made a bad
bargain.
  This consciousness acquired individuality: a worse

    [158]
      COMMENTARY ({Omicron-Delta})
Carey Street is well known to prosperous Hebrews
  and poor Englishmen as the seat of the Bankruptcy
    buildings.
      Paragraphs 1-4 are in prose, the downward course,
and the rest of the chapter in poetry, the upward.
  The first part shows the fall from Nought in four
    steps; the second part, the return.
      The details of this Hierarchy have already been
indicated in various chapters.  It is quite conventional
  mysticism.
    Step 1, the illumination of Ain as Ain Soph Aour;
      step 2, the concentration of Ain Soph Aour in Kether;
step 3, duality and the rest of it down to Malkuth;
  step 4, the stooping of Malkuth to the Qliphoth, and
    the consequent ruin of the Tree of Life.
      Part 2 show the impossibility of stopping on the
Path of Adeptship.
  The final couplet represents the first step upon the
    Path, which must be taken even although the aspirant
      is intellectually aware of the severity of the whole
course.  You must give up the world for love, the
  material for the moral idea, before that, in its turn, is
    surrendered to the spiritual.  And so on.  This is a

  Spring beans and strawberries are in: goodbye to the
    oyster!
      If I really knew what I wanted, I could give up
Laylah, or give up everything for Laylah.
  But "what I want" varies from hour to hour.
    This wavering is the root of all compromise, and so
      of all good sense.
With this gift a man can spend his seventy years in
  peace.
    Now is this well or ill?
      Emphasise gift, then man, then spend, then seventy
years, and lastly peace, and change the intonations
  --each time reverse the meaning!
    I would show you how; but-for the moment!
      --I prefer to think of Laylah.
[160]
  COMMENTARY ({Omicron-Epsilon})
    The title is explained in the note, but also alludes to
      paragraph 1, the plover's egg being often contemporary
with the early strawberry.
  Paragraph 1 means that change of diet is pleasant;
    vanity pleases the mind; the idee fixe is a sign of
      insanity.  See paragraphs 4 and 5.
Paragraph 6 puts the question, "Then is sanity or
  insanity desirable?"  The oak is weakened by the ivy
    which clings around it, but perhaps the ivy keeps it
      from going mad.
The next paragraph expresses the difficulty of
  expressing thought in writing; it seems, on the face of
    it, absurd that the the text of this book, composed as it is
      of English, simple, austere, and terse, should need a
commentary.  But it does so, or my most gifted Chela
  and myself would hardly have been at the pains to
    write one.  It was in response to the impassioned appeals
      of many most worthy brethren that we have yielded up
that time and thought which gold could not have bought,
  or torture wrested.
    Laylah is again the mere woman.

      [162]
COMMENTARY ({Omicron-Digamma})
  Phaeton was the charioteer of the Sun in Greek mythology.
    At first sight the prose of this chapter, though there is only one dissyllabl
      e in
it, appears difficult; but this is a glamour cast by Maya.  It is a compendium
  of
    various systems of philosophy.
      No = Nihilism; Yes = Monism, and all dogmatic systems; Perhaps =
Pyrrhonism and Agnosticism; O! = The system of Liber Legis.  (See Chapter 0.)
  Eye = Phallicism (cf. Chapters 61 and 70); I = Fichteanism; Hi! =
    Transcendentalism; Y? = Scepticism, and the method of science.  No denies
      all these and closes the argument.
But all this is a glamour cast by Maya; the real meaning of the prose of this
  chapter is as follows:
    No, some negative conception beyond the IT spoken of in Chapters 31, 49
      and elsewhere.
Yes, IT.
  Perhaps, the flux of these.
    O!, Nuit, Hadit, Ra-Hoor-Khuit.
      Eye, the phallus in Kether.
I, the Ego in Chokmah.
  Hi!, Binah, the feminine principle fertilised.  (He by Yod.)
    Y?, the Abyss.
      No, the refusal to be content with any of this.
But all this is again only a glamour of Maya, as previously observed in the
  text (Chapter 31).  All this is true and false, and it is true and false to say
    that
      it is true and false.
The prose of this chapter combines, and of course denies, all these meanings,
  both singly and in combination.  It is intended to stimulate thought to the
    point where it explodes with violence and for ever.
      A study of this chapter is probably the best short cut to Nibbana.
The thought of the Master in this chapter is exceptionally lofty.
  That this is the true meaning, or rather use, of this chapter, is evident fro
    m
      the poetry.
The master salutes the previous paragraphs as horses which, although in
  themselves worthless animals (without the epithets), carry the Charioteer in th
    e
      path of the Sun.  The question, How?  Not by their own virtues, but by the
silence which results when they are all done with.
  The word "neigh" is a pun on "nay", which refers to the negative conception
    already postulated as beyond IT.  The suggestion is, that there may be somethin
      g
falsely described as silence, to represent absence-of-conception beyond that
  negative.
    It would be possible to interpret this chapter in its entirety as an adverse
      criticism of metaphysics as such, and this is doubtless one of its many sub-
meanings.

THE SUBLIME AND SUPREME SEPTENARY
  IN ITS MATURE MAGICAL MANIFESTATION
    THROUGH MATTER:  AS IT IS WRITTEN: AN
      HE-GOAT ALSO
Laylah.
  [164]
    COMMENTARY ({Omicron-Zeta})
      77 is the number of Laylah (LAILAH), to whom this
chapter is wholly devoted.
  The first section of the title is an analysis of 77 considered
    as a mystic number.
      7, the septenary; 11, the magical number; 77, the mani-
festation, therefore, of the septenary.
  Through matter, because 77 is written in Hebrew Ayin
    Zayin (OZ), and He-Goat, the symbol of matter, Capri-
      cornus, the Devil of the Tarot; which is the picture of the
Goat of the Sabbath upon an altar, worshipped by two other
  devils, male and female.
    As will be seen from the photogravure inserted opposite
      this chapter, Laylah is herself not devoid of "Devil", but,
as she habitually remarks, on being addressed in terms
  implying this fact, "It's nice to be a devil when you're one
    like me."
      The text need no comment, but it will be noticed that it is
much shorter that the title.
  Now, the Devil of the Tarot is the Phallus, the Redeemer,
    and Laylah symbolises redemption to Frater P.  The
      number 77, also, interpreted as in the title, is the redeeming
force.
  The ratio of the length of title and text is the key to the
    true meaning of the chapter, which is, that Redemption is
      really as simple as it appears complex, that the names (or
veils) of truth are obscure and many, the Truth itself plain
  and one; but that the latter must be reached through the
    former.  This chapter is therefore an apology, were one
      needed, for the Book of Lies itself.  In these few simple
words, it explains the necessity of the book, and offers it-
  humbly, yet with confidence-as a means of redemption to
    the world of sorrowing men.
      The name with full-stops: L.A.Y.L.A.H. represents an
analysis of the name, which may be left to the ingenium of
  the advanced practicus (see photograph).

      All these Wheels be one; yet of all these the Wheel of

  And lo! thou art past through the Abyss.
    [166]
      COMMENTARY ({Omicron-Eta})
The number of this chapter is that of the cards of the
  Tarot.
    The title of this chapter is a pun of the phrase "weal
      and woe".  It means motion and rest.  The moral is the
conventional mystic one; stop thought at its source!
  Five wheels are mentioned in this chapter; all but
    the third refer to the universe as it is; but the wheel of
      the Tarot is not only this, but represents equally the
Magickal Path.
  This practice is therefore given by Frater P. to
    his pupils; to treat the sequence of the cards as cause
      and effect.  Thence, to discover the cause behind all
causes. Success in this practice qualifies for the grade
  of Master of the Temple.
    In the penultimate paragraph the bracketed passage
      reminds the student that the universe is not to be
contemplated as a phenomenon in time.

THE BAL BULLIER
  Some men look into their minds into their memories,
    and find naught but pain and shame.
      These then proclaim "The Good Law" unto mankind.
These preach renunciation, "virtue", cowardice in
  every form.
    These whine eternally.
      Smug, toothless, hairless Coote, debauch-emascu-
lated Buddha, come ye to me?  I have a trick to
  make you silent, O ye foamers-at-the mouth!
    Nature is wasteful; but how well She can afford it!
      Nature is false; but I'm a bit of a liar myself.
Nature is useless; but then how beautiful she is!
  Nature is cruel; but I too am a Sadist.
    The game goes on; it y have been too rough for
      Buddha, but it's (if anything) too dull for me.
Viens, beau negre!  Donne-moi tes levres encore!
  [168]
    COMMENTARY ({Omicron-Theta})
      the title of this chapter is a place frequented by
Frater P. until it became respectable.
  The chapter is a rebuke to those who can see nothing
    but sorrow and evil in the universe.
      The Buddhist analysis may be true, but not for
men of courage.  The plea that "love is sorrow", because
  its ecstasies are only transitory, is contemptible.
    Paragraph 5.  Coote is a blackmailer exposed by The
      Equinox.  The end of the paragraph refers to Catullus,
his famous epigram about the youth who turned his
  uncle into Harpocrates.  It is a subtle way for Frater P.
    to insist upon his virility, since otherwise he could not
      employ the remedy.
The last paragraph is a quotation.  In Paris,
  Negroes are much sought after by sportive ladies.  This
    is therefore presumably intended to assert that even
      women may enjoy life sometimes.
The word "Sadist" is taken from the famous Marquis
  de Sade, who gave supreme literary form to the joys of
    torture.

      Frater P. continues the subject of Chapter 79.
He pictures himself as a vigorous, reckless, almost
  rowdy Irishman.  he is no thin-lipped prude, to seek
    salvation in unmanly self-abnegation; no Creeping
      Jesus, to slink through existence to the tune of the Dead
March in Saul; no Cremerian Callus to warehouse his
  semen in his cerebellum.
    "New Thoughtist" is only Old Eunuch writ small.
      Paragraph 2 gives the very struggle for life, which
disheartens modern thinkers, as a good enough reason for
  existence.
    Paragraph 5 expresses the sorrow of the modern
      thinker, and paragraph 6 Frater P.'s suggestion for
replying to such critics.

[172]
  COMMENTARY ({Pi-Alpha})
    The title is the name of one of the authors of the affair
      of the Haymarket, in Chicago.  See Frank Harris,
"The Bomb".
  Paragraph 1 explains that Frater P. sees no use
    in the employment of such feeble implements as bombs.
      Nor does he agree even with the aim of the Anarchists,
since, although Anarchists themselves need no restraint,
  not daring to drink cocoa, lest their animal passions
    should be aroused (as Olivia Haddon assures my
      favourite Chela), yet policemen, unless most severely
repressed, would be dangerous wild beasts.
  The last bitter sentence is terribly true; the personal
    liberty of the Russian is immensely greater than that of
      the Englishman.  The latest Radical devices for
securing freedom have turned nine out of ten English-
  men into Slaves, obliged to report their movements to
    the government like so many ticket-of-leave men.
      The only solution of the Social Problem is the
creation of a class with the true patriarchal feeling,
  and the manners and obligations of chivalry.

    Witch-moon that turnest all the streams to blood,
      I take this hazel rod, and stand, and swear
An Oath-beneath this blasted Oak and bare
  That rears its agony above the flood
    Whose swollen mask mutters an atheist's prayer.
      What oath may stand the shock of this offence:
"There is no I, no joy, no permanence"?
  Witch-moon of blood, eternal ebb and flow
    Of baffled birth, in death still lurks a change;
      And all the leopards in thy woods that range,
And all the vampires in their boughs that glow,
  Brooding on blood-thirst-these are not so strange
    And fierce as life's unfailing shower.  These die,
      Yet time rebears them through eternity.
Hear then the Oath, with-moon of blood, dread
  moon!
    Let all thy stryges and thy ghouls attend!
      He that endureth even to the end
Hath sworn that Love's own corpse shall lie at noon
  Even in the coffin of its hopes, and spend

      COMMENTARY ({Pi-Beta})
The title of this chapter, and its two sub-titles, will
  need no explanation to readers of the classics.
    This poem, inspired by Jane Cheron, is as simple
      as it is elegant.
The poet asks, in verse 1, How can we baffle the
  Three Characteristics?
    In verse 2, he shows that death is impotent against
      life.
In verse 3, he offers the solution of the problem.
  This is, to accept things as they are, and to turn
    your whole energies to progress on the Path.

    THE BLIND PIG(41)
      Many becomes two: two one: one Naught.  What
comes to Naught?
  What!  shall the Adept give up his hermit life, and
    go eating and drinking and making merry?
      Ay! shall he not do so? he knows that the Many is
Naught; and having Naught, enjoys that Naught
  even in the enjoyment of the Many.
    For when Naught becomes Absolute Naught, it
      becomes again the Many.
Any this Many and this Naught are identical; they
  are not correlatives or phases of some one deeper
    Absence-of-Idea; they are not aspects of some
      further Light: they are They!
Beware, O my brother, lest this chapter deceive
  thee!
    [176]
      COMMENTARY ({Pi-Gamma})
The title of this chapter refers to the Greek number,
  PG being "Pig" without an "i".
    The subject of the chapter is consequently corollary
      to Chapters 79 and 80, the ethics of Adept life.
The Adept has performed the Great Work; He has
  reduced the Many to Naught; as a consequence, he
    is no longer afraid of the Many.
      Paragraph 4.  See berashith.
Paragraph 5, takes things for what they are; give up
  interpreting, refining away, analysing.  Be simple and
    lucid and radiant as Frater P.
      Paragraph 6.  With this commentary there is no
further danger, and the warning becomes superfluous.

    THE AVALANCHE
      Only through devotion to FRATER PERDURABO
may this book be understood.
  How much more then should He devote Himself to
    AIWASS for the understanding of the Holy Books
      of {Theta-Epsilon-Lambda-Eta-Mu-Alpha}?
Yet must he labour underground eternally.  The
  sun is not for him, nor the flowers, nor the voices
    of the birds; for he is past beyond all these.  Yea,
      verily, oft-times he is weary; it is well that the
weight of the Karma of the Infinite is with him.
  Therefore is he glad indeed; for he hath finished THE
    WORK; and the reward concerneth him no whit.
      [178]
COMMENTARY ({Pi-Delta})
  This continues the subject of Chapter 83.
    The title refers to the mental attitude of the Master;
      the avalanche does not fall because it is tired of staying
on the mountain, or in order to crush the Alps below it,
  or because that it feels that it needs exercise.  Perfectly
    unconscious, perfectly indifferent, it obeys the laws of
      Cohesion and of Gravitation.
It is the sun and its own weight that loosen it.
  So, also, is the act of the Adept.  "Delivered from the
    lust of result, he is every way perfect."
      Paragraphs 1 and 2.  By "devotion to Frater Per-
durabo" is not meant sycophancy, but intelligent
  reference and imaginative sympathy.  Put your mind
    in tune with his; identify yourself with him as he
      seeks to identify himself with the Intelligence that
communicates to him the Holy Books.
  Paragraphs 3 and 4 are explained by the 13th

  All other thoughts are surely symptoms of disease.
    Yet these are often beautiful, and may be true within

Any yet again!  Do we not find that the most robust
  of men express no thoughts at all?  They eat, drink,
    sleep, and copulate in silence.
      What better proof of the fact that all thought is
dis-ease?
  We are Strassburg geese; the tastiness of our talk

  [182]
    COMMENTARY ({Pi-Digamma})
      The number 86 refers to Elohim, the name of the elemental
forces.
  The title is the Sanskrit for That, in its sense of "The Existing".
    This chapter is an attempt to replace Elohim by a more
      satisfactory hieroglyph of the elements.
The best attribution of Elohim is Aleph, Air; Lamed, Earth;
  He, Spirit; Yod, Fire; Mem, Water.  But the order is not good;
    Lamed is not satisfactory for Earth, and Yod too spiritualised a
      form of Fire.  (But see Book 4, part III.)
Paragraphs 1-6.  Out of Nothing, Nothing is made.  The word
  Nihil is taken to affirm that the universe is Nothing, and that is
    now to be analysed.  The order of the element is that of Jeheshua.
      The elements are taken rather as in Nature; N is easily Fire,
since Mars is the ruler of Scorpio: the virginity of I suits Air
  and Water, elements which in Magick are closely interwoven:
    H, the letter of of breath, is suitable for Spirit; Abrahadabra is
      called the name of Spirit, because it is cheth: L is Earth, green
and fertile, because Venus, the greenness, fertility, and earthiness
  of things is the Lady of Libra, Lamed.
    In paragraph 7 we turn to the so-called Jetziratic attribution
      of Pentagrammaton, that followed by Dr. Dee, and by the Hindus,
Tibetans, Chinese and Japanese.  Fire is the Foundation, the
  central core, of things; above this forms a crust, tormented
    from below, and upon this condenses the original steam. Around this
      flows the air, created by Earth and Water through the action of
vegetation.
  Such is the globe; but all this is a mere strain in the aethyr,
    {Alpha-Iota-Theta-Eta-Rho}.  Here is a new Pentagrammaton, presumably suitable
      for another analysis of the elements; but after a different manner.
Alpha ({Alpha}) is Air; Rho ({Rho}) the Sun; these are the Spirit and the
  Son of Christian theology.  In the midst is the Father, expressed
    as Father-and-Mother.  I-H (Yod and He), Eta ({Eta}) being used
      to express "the Mother" instead of Epsilon ({Epsilon}), to show that She
has been impregnated by the Spirit; it is the rough breathing and
  not the soft.  The centre of all is Theta ({Theta}), which was originally
    written as a point in a circle ({Sun}), the sublime  hieroglyph of the
      Sun in the Macrocosm, and in the Microcosm of the Lingam
in conjunction with the Yoni.
  This word {Alpha-Iota-Theta-Eta-Rho} (Aethyr) is therefore a perfect hierogly
    ph
      of the Cosmos in terms of Gnostic Theology.
The reader should consult La Messe et ses Mysteres, par Jean
  'Marie de V .... (Paris et Nancy, 1844), for a complete
    demonstration of the incorporation of the Solar and Phallic
      Mysteries in Christianity.

The term "gold bricks" is borrowed from American

  on receipt of a shilling.  To every sender he dispatched
    a post-card with these words: "Do as I do."

    Frater P. had been annoyed by a scurvy doctor, the
      number of whose house was 89.
He shows that his mind was completely poisoned in
  respect of that number by his allowing himself to be
    annoyed.
      (But note that a good Qabalist cannot err.  "In Him
all is right." 89 is Body-that which annoys-and
  the Angel of the Lord of Despair and Cruelty.
    Also "Silence" and "Shut Up".
      The four meanings completely describe the chapter.)

      STARLIGHT
Behold!  I have lived many years, and I have travelled
  in every land that is under the dominion of the
    Sun, and I have sailed the seas from pole to pole.
      Now do I lift up my voice and testify that all is
vanity on earth, except the love of a good woman,
  and that good woman LAYLAH.  And I testify
    that in heaven all is vanity (for I have journeyed
      oft, and sojourned oft, in every heaven), except the
love of OUR LADY BABALON.  And I testify
  that beyond heaven and earth is the love of OUR
    LADY NUIT.
      And seeing that I am old and well stricken in years,
and that my natural forces fail, therefore do I rise
  up i my throne and call upon THE END.
    For I am youth eternal and force infinite.
      ANd at THE END is SHE that was LAYLAH, and
BABALON, and NUIT, being...

    COMMENTARY ({Rho})
      This chapter is a sort of final Confession of Faith.
It is the unification of all symbols and all planes.
  The End is expressible.

  THE HEIKLE
    A. M. E. N.
      COMMENTARY ({Rho-Alpha)
The "Heikle" is to be distinguished from the
  "Huckle", which latter is defined in the late Sir W.S.
    Gilbert's "Prince Cherry-Top".
      A clear definition of the Heikle might have been
obtained from Mr Oscar Eckenstein, 34 Greencroft
  Gardens, South Hampstead, London, N.W. (when
    this comment was written).
      But its general nature is that of a certain minute
whiteness, appearing at the extreme end of great
  blackness.
    It is a good title for the last chapter of this book, and
      it also symbolises the eventual coming out into the light
of his that has wandered long in the darkness.
  91 is the numberation of Amen.
    The chapter consists of an analysis of this word, but
      gives no indication as to the result of this analysis, as
if to imply this: The final Mystery is always insoluble.
