as she walks through the room, i can see generations of men pass from vividly living
to under the angel of death's tender care.
as she comes and touches me, i can see generations of come to life from the stars
to this blue spot in space the is called Earth
She is kata-tonya taivos, an incarnation of a Goddess of the underworld
